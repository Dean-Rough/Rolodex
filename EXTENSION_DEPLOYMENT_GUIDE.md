## 🌐 Live Site Hosting Analysis

Based on your project structure, you're likely using one of these hosting platforms:

### Current Setup Detection:
- ✅ **Database**: Supabase (detected from `.env`)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Next.js application 
- ❓ **Hosting**: Not immediately apparent

### Most Likely Hosting Options:

#### Option 1: Vercel (Most Common for Next.js)
```bash
# If using Vercel
npm install -g vercel
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 2: Netlify
```bash
# If using Netlify
npm run build
# Upload dist folder to Netlify
```

#### Option 3: Railway/Render
```bash
# If using Railway
railway login
railway deploy
```

## 🔍 **How to Determine Your Current Hosting**

Since I couldn't definitively identify your hosting setup, here's how to check:

### Method 1: Check Browser Network Tab
1. Visit your live site
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Look at response headers for hosting clues:
   - `server: Vercel` = Vercel
   - `x-served-by: Netlify` = Netlify  
   - `server: railway` = Railway

### Method 2: DNS Lookup
```bash
# Check where your domain points
dig your-domain.com
nslookup your-domain.com
```

### Method 3: Check Package.json Scripts
Look for deployment commands:
- `"deploy": "vercel"` = Vercel
- `"deploy": "netlify deploy"` = Netlify
- `"build": "railway deploy"` = Railway
