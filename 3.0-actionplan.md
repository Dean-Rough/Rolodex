# Rolodex 3.0 Audit & Action Plan

## Part 1. Technical Audit

### Codebase & Architecture
- **Backend coupling** – `backend/main.py` mixes route definitions, database access, async background orchestration, and AI enrichment code. Refactoring into routers plus service modules will improve testability and let us inject different storage or AI providers.
- **Storage client lifecycle** – `backend/storage.py` initializes Supabase and OpenAI clients at import time, which raises exceptions if credentials are absent. Lazy initialization plus dependency injection will keep local tooling from crashing.
- **Extension footprint** – The MV2-era service worker handles configuration, authentication, capture, retries, and analytics in one bundle. For MV3 we should promote a slimmer orchestration surface that forwards context to the web app.
- **Frontend prototype code** – `frontend/app/page.tsx` still consumes mock/demo tokens and generates fake library entries. We need authenticated data fetching, project-scoped queries, and shared component primitives.

### Quality & Tooling
- **Automated testing gaps** – Backend tests only cover `/health`; frontend Jest and Playwright suites assert on placeholder copy. Expand coverage with realistic fixtures, contract tests, and smoke journeys that reflect today’s UI.
- **CI/DevEx** – There is no enforced CI pipeline. Add lint/type/test jobs, seed scripts, and one-click environment bootstrap instructions.
- **Documentation drift** – PRD promises right-click capture, editable metadata, projects, and moodboard exports, yet large portions remain unimplemented. Align README/BUILD docs with the actual setup process.

## Part 2. Product & UX Assessment

### Experience Review
- **Capture journey** – Designers cannot confirm whether the extension saved anything because the current flow depends on heavy background logic. A simple handoff into a focused capture workspace will build trust.
- **Library reality** – The grid/list toggle and filters are attractive but operate on mock data. Without real search, bulk actions, or project context the tool fails the promised “designer-grade workspace”.
- **Projects & exports** – No working projects dashboard, moodboard canvas, or export surface exists, so the product does not yet deliver on the concept of “deploying” FF&E inspiration.

### Recommendations
- Ground each surface (capture, library, projects, moodboards) in a narrative of “confirm, organize, present”.
- Add progressive disclosure so designers can save quickly and refine later (drafts, quick edits, reminders).
- Instrument success metrics (capture conversion, project activity, export usage) to inform PM decisions.

## Part 3. Imagineer Blueprint

### Vision
Rolodex 3.0 is the fastest, most trustworthy way for interior designers to capture inspiration from the web, enrich it with AI, and assemble polished presentations. The Chrome extension becomes a lightweight trigger that opens a rich web experience rather than duplicating business logic.

### Experience Pillars
1. **Capture without friction** – Context menu launch → prefilled capture workspace → save in under three steps.
2. **Design-grade workspace** – Library, projects, and moodboards feel like professional design tools with drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, and responsive layouts.
3. **Trustworthy intelligence** – AI enrichment is transparent, editable, and never blocks manual control.
4. **Invisible infrastructure** – Background services are observable, resilient, and compliant with Chrome Store requirements.

## Rolodex 3.0 Roadmap (9 Weeks)

### Phase 0 – Foundations (Weeks 0–2)
- Spin up staging Supabase + Fly.io backend with secret management and data parity.
- Enforce CI with lint, type-check, unit, and smoke tests across frontend/backend/extension.
- Implement OTLP tracing, structured logging, and alerting for failure budgets.
- Refresh Figma kit, tokens, and capture flow documentation for designers and engineers.

### Phase 1 – Extension 3.0 & Capture Launcher (Weeks 2–4)
- Ship Manifest V3 extension handling only context menu, environment detection, and secure deep-link handoff to `/capture`.
- Support signed JWT deep links (`/capture?image=…&source=…`) with limited lifetime tokens.
- Provide zero-install developer scripts plus MV3 linting and packaging automation.

### Phase 2 – Capture Workspace (Weeks 2–5)
- Build dedicated `/capture` route with hero preview, editable metadata form, AI extraction indicators, and confidence badges.
- Integrate AI extraction service with graceful fallbacks, inline validation, and draft persistence.
- Enable autosave and reminders for incomplete captures so work is never lost.

### Phase 3 – Library & Projects Refresh (Weeks 4–7)
- Replace demo token logic with real Supabase or Clerk auth; add API authorization guards.
- Ship refreshed library grid/list with saved filters, semantic/text search toggle, bulk actions, and a project sidebar.
- Implement project moodboard canvas with drag-and-drop, snapping, templates, and PDF/JPG export pipelines.

### Phase 4 – AI & Automation Enhancements (Weeks 6–8)
- Fine-tune extraction prompts per retailer and introduce background queues for retries/enrichment.
- Add palette/material detection microservices and store embeddings for advanced search and recommendations.
- Launch a “Suggest for Brief” endpoint that curates collections via vector similarity plus rule engine.

### Phase 5 – Polish & Launch (Weeks 8–9)
- Complete accessibility audit (WCAG 2.2 AA), keyboard coverage, and screen-reader scripts.
- Externalize copy for localization (English baseline with Spanish/Italian placeholders).
- Prepare Chrome Web Store assets, motion previews, marketing landing refresh, and beta onboarding.

## Cross-Functional Workstreams

1. **Chrome Extension Lite** – Modularize config/storage utilities, add OAuth handshake, and emit telemetry for install/context events. Bundle packaging with checksum for release candidates.
2. **Capture & Library Frontend** – Build capture form primitives (image cropper, hex picker, price parser), integrate Supabase session management with SWR caching, and polish UX with skeletons/microinteractions.
3. **Backend & AI Platform** – Split FastAPI into routers/services, lazily initialize clients, enforce Supabase JWT validation, and introduce a Celery (or equivalent) task queue for extraction + embedding jobs.
4. **Data, Search & Analytics** – Harden pgvector schema, add migration tooling, capture search quality telemetry, and wire usage analytics (Segment → BigQuery) for capture success and engagement.
5. **Quality, Security & Compliance** – Expand pytest/Jest/Playwright coverage, align copy with tests, complete threat modeling, and publish release + rollback checklists.
6. **Go-To-Market & Operations** – Recruit designer beta cohort, add NPS prompts, prepare marketing collateral, document support workflows, and define pricing experiments.

## Conclusion
By combining the technical hardening in Part 1, the product and UX focus from Part 2, and the visionary blueprint in Part 3 with the phased roadmap above, the Rolodex team can deliver a lightweight extension that unlocks a polished, intelligent web workspace. Executed together, these tracks become Rolodex 3.0—a reliable, designer-grade system for capturing, organizing, and presenting FF&E inspiration.
