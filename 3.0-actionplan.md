# Rolodex 3.0 Action Plan

## Vision & North Star
- Deliver the fastest way for interior designers to capture, enrich, and deploy FF&E inspiration from any website, aligning with our MVP stories for right-click capture, AI-assisted metadata, searchable library, projects, and exportable moodboards.【F:PRD.md†L11-L32】
- Maintain the immaculate, design-tool-quality aesthetic defined in our UI/UX principles while ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across surfaces.【F:UIUX.md†L3-L39】
- Keep the browser extension lightweight: it should trigger the web app’s capture surface and defer heavy logic to the backend so we stay within Chrome MV3 best practices and minimize maintenance overhead.【F:extension-v3-simplified/background.js†L1-L19】【F:ARCHITECTURE.md†L21-L42】

### Success Criteria
- <1 minute to capture a product from a new retailer, enrich metadata, and save it to a project library.
- ≥90% AI metadata accuracy for title, vendor, price, and color on top 50 retailer domains.
- Library search responses <500 ms for text, <800 ms for semantic queries with vector recall.
- Chrome Web Store approval on first submission, 4.8★ user rating at 3 months.

## Experience Pillars
1. **Capture without friction** – The extension opens a focused capture workspace in the web app pre-filled with scraped context; users confirm and save in under 3 steps.
2. **Design-grade workspace** – Library, projects, and moodboards feel like professional design tools (keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop, live color chips, export-ready layouts).
3. **Trustworthy intelligence** – AI assists but never blocks; edits and fallbacks are obvious, with transparent logs.
4. **Invisible infrastructure** – Sync, storage, and AI pipelines run reliably with observable metrics and clear failure handling.

## Phase Roadmap (9-week target)

### Phase 0 – Foundations (Weeks 0–2)
- Stand up staging Supabase project & Fly.io backend with environment parity and secrets management.
- Harden CI: lint, type-check, unit + API contract tests for backend; Jest + Playwright smoke suite for frontend.
- Set up logging/monitoring (OTLP traces, structured logs, alerting on failure budgets).
- Refresh Figma kit & design tokens to match UI/UX guidelines; document capture flow states.

### Phase 1 – Extension 3.0 & Capture Launcher (Weeks 2–4)
- Ship Manifest V3 extension that only handles context menu, env detection, and secure web-app handoff (no direct API writes).【F:extension-v3-simplified/background.js†L1-L19】
- Implement signed deep links (`/capture?image=…&source=…`) with JWT payload to prefill capture workspace.
- Create zero-install developer workflow (npm scripts + Chrome devtools instructions) and automated MV3 linting.

### Phase 2 – Capture Workspace (Weeks 2–5)
- Build dedicated `/capture` route: hero preview, editable metadata form, AI extraction progress indicators, and confidence badges.
- Integrate AI extraction service with graceful fallbacks and inline validation (color picker, vendor autocomplete).
- Persist drafts so users never lose work if they navigate away.

### Phase 3 – Library & Projects Refresh (Weeks 4–7)
- Replace demo token with real Supabase or Clerk auth; enforce API authorization guards.
- Ship new library grid/list with saved filters, instant semantic/text toggle, bulk actions, and project sidebar.
- Implement project moodboard canvas with drag-and-drop, snapping, templates, and PDF/JPG export hooks.

### Phase 4 – AI & Automation Enhancements (Weeks 6–8)
- Fine-tune extraction prompts per-retailer; add background worker queue for retries and enrichment.
- Add palette & material detection microservices, storing embeddings + metadata for advanced search.【F:docs/schema.sql†L12-L94】【F:backend/storage.py†L161-L277】
- Launch “Suggest for Brief” endpoint to auto-curate collections using vector similarity and rules engine.

### Phase 5 – Polish & Launch (Weeks 8–9)
- Accessibility sweep (WCAG 2.2 AA), keyboard coverage, screen reader scripts.
- Localization framework (copy externalization, en→es/it placeholders).
- Chrome Web Store assets, motion previews, landing page refresh, and beta onboarding program.

## Cross-Functional Workstreams

### 1. Chrome Extension Lite
- **Deliverables**: Manifest v3, context menu trigger, config/env detection, OAuth handshake, telemetry.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Modularize config and secure storage utilities for tokenless capture (token retrieval occurs in web app session).
  - Implement analytics pings (install, context click, handoff success) via `chrome.storage.session` + fetch beacon.
  - Automated packaging script with zip + checksum for release candidates.

### 2. Capture & Library Frontend
- **Deliverables**: `/capture` flow, refreshed `/library`, `/projects`, `/moodboard` pages, component kit.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Build capture form components (image cropper, hex picker, price parser) using shadcn/ui patterns.【F:UIUX.md†L9-L52】
  - Integrate Supabase session management, optimistic updates, and SWR-based caching replacing demo token logic.【F:frontend/app/page.tsx†L8-L146】
  - Add visual polish: skeletons, microinteractions, theme sync, keyboard shortcuts.

### 3. Backend & AI Platform
- **Deliverables**: Authenticated REST API, async extraction worker, storage pipeline, observability.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Refactor FastAPI app into modular routers/services with dependency injection and background queue abstraction.【F:backend/main.py†L233-L417】
  - Lazily initialize storage/AI clients to avoid import-time crashes; add retries, circuit breakers, and structured logging.【F:backend/storage.py†L26-L309】
  - Implement Supabase-compatible JWT validation, role-based access, and project/item ownership enforcement.
  - Introduce Celery or distributed task queue for embeddings/extractions with idempotent job records.

### 4. Data, Search & Analytics
- **Deliverables**: Vector search, usage dashboards, quality scoring.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Harden pgvector schema, add migration tooling, and implement search result quality telemetry.【F:docs/schema.sql†L3-L95】
  - Build analytics pipeline (Segment → BigQuery) for capture success, AI accuracy, and library engagement.
  - Define data retention & privacy policies; implement GDPR/CCPA delete workflows.

### 5. Quality, Security & Compliance
- **Deliverables**: Automated test suite, threat model, release checklist.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Expand backend pytest suite (unit + integration + contract) beyond the lone health check.【F:backend/tests/test_health.py†L1-L11】
  - Align frontend Jest/Playwright tests with actual UI copy to prevent false failures.【F:frontend/__tests__/page.test.tsx†L5-L12】【F:frontend/tests/smoke.spec.ts†L3-L7】
  - Security review: CSP, permission minimization, content validation, secure storage of secrets.
  - Release checklist covering rollback plans, monitoring, support playbooks.

### 6. Go-To-Market & Operations
- **Deliverables**: Beta recruitment, pricing experiment plan, support workflows.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Define designer beta cohort, weekly feedback loop, and in-product NPS prompts.
  - Prepare marketing site updates, video walkthroughs, and Chrome Store listing assets.
  - Document support scripts, known issues, and escalation paths.

## Resourcing & Next Steps
- Assemble squad pods: **Capture** (FE + Ext + PMM), **Library** (FE + BE + Design), **Platform** (BE + AI + DevOps).
- Kick off weekly demos + quality gates; adopt RFC process for architectural changes.
- Within Week 1, finalize scope, confirm dependencies, and schedule usability tests with 5 pilot designers.
