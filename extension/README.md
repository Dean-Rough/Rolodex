# Legacy Extension (Dev-Only)

This `extension/` directory contains an initial prototype of the Chrome extension used only for local development experiments.

Do not ship or publish this version. It uses hardcoded `http://localhost:*` endpoints and lacks security features.

Use `extension-v2.0.0/` for any real testing, packaging, or store submission.
