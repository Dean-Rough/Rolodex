### **Product Audit Report: Rolodex**

**Overall Assessment:**

The project has a strong foundation and a clear vision. The documentation is excellent, outlining a compelling product for interior designers. The backend is well-structured with a good separation of concerns, and the frontend has a modern tech stack. However, there's a significant gap between the product vision and the current implementation. The application is currently in a very early, pre-MVP state.

### **The Good üëç**

*   **Clear Vision & Documentation:** The `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `UIUX.md` are well-written and provide a clear roadmap. This is a huge asset for any development team.
*   **Solid Backend Foundation:**
    *   The FastAPI backend is a good choice for this type of application.
    *   The use of SQLAlchemy and a connection pool is good practice.
    *   Basic API endpoints for `items` and `projects` are implemented.
    *   Health checks are in place.
    *   Basic auth is implemented (though it needs to be hardened).
*   **Modern Frontend Stack:**
    *   Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS are a modern and powerful combination.
    *   The project is set up for testing with Jest and Playwright.
    *   The basic file structure is in place.
*   **Basic Extension:** The browser extension is functional at a basic level, allowing users to save an image URL.

### **The Bad üëé**

*   **Pre-MVP Implementation:** The application is far from the MVP described in the `PRD.md`. Key features are missing, and existing features are incomplete.
*   **Frontend is a Static Page:** The frontend is currently just a static landing page. There is no application logic, no data fetching, and no UI for managing items or projects. It doesn't implement any of the components from the `UIUX.md`.
*   **Backend is a Stub:**
    *   The `/api/extract` endpoint is a stub and does not perform any actual AI extraction. This is a core feature of the product.
    *   The API only saves the `img_url`, not any of the other fields from the `items` table in the database schema.
    *   There's no implementation for moodboards, a key feature from the `PRD.md`.
*   **Extension is Too Simple:** The extension only sends the `img_url` to the backend. It doesn't grab any other context from the page, and it doesn't provide any feedback to the user on success or failure.
*   **Inconsistent Schema:** The `docs/schema.sql` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` have a `users` table, but the backend code doesn't create or manage users. The auth is based on a pseudo user ID derived from a token.
*   **Missing UI/UX Polish:** The frontend does not use `shadcn/ui`, `Geist` font, or any of the other UI/UX elements specified in `UIUX.md`.

### **Recommendations & Next Steps**

1.  **Focus on the Frontend:** The highest priority should be to build out the frontend application. Start by implementing the UI for displaying items in a grid, creating projects, and adding items to projects.
2.  **Implement Real AI Extraction:** The stubbed `/api/extract` endpoint needs to be replaced with a real implementation that calls an AI service (like OpenAI's CLIP or a similar model) to extract product data.
3.  **Complete the Backend API:**
    *   The `/api/items` endpoint should be updated to save all the extracted data, not just the `img_url`.
    *   Implement the moodboard generation functionality.
    *   Flesh out the authentication and user management.
4.  **Enhance the Extension:** The extension needs to be improved to provide user feedback and to extract more context from the page when an image is saved.
5.  **Bridge the Gap:** The development team should work to bring the implementation in line with the excellent documentation that has been created.

This project has a lot of potential, but there is a lot of work to be done to realize the vision. The next phase of development should focus on building out the core features and creating a functional MVP.
